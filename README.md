# Real-Time Chat Application üöÄüí¨

A real-time chat application built with **React** (frontend) and **Golang** (backend). This project allows users to send and receive messages instantly, making it ideal for real-time communication platforms.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Real-time messaging**: Messages are delivered instantly between users using WebSockets.
- **Multiple rooms**: Users can join different chat rooms and send messages within those rooms.
- **Responsive UI**: A modern, mobile-friendly interface built with React.
- **User authentication**: Secure login and registration flow using JWT tokens.
- **Typing indicators**: Real-time display of typing indicators.
- **Message history**: View past messages for continuity.
  
## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- **Frontend**: React, Redux, Socket.IO (for real-time communication)
- **Backend**: Go (Golang), Gorilla WebSocket (for WebSocket connections)
- **Database**: In-memory (or you can extend it to use MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Styling**: CSS/SCSS, Styled-components, or Tailwind CSS (your choice)

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Prerequisites

To run the application locally, you‚Äôll need:

- Node.js (for frontend)
- Go (for backend)
- Yarn or npm (for managing frontend dependencies)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/realtime-chat-app.git
   cd realtime-chat-app
   ```

2. **Set up the backend (Go)**:

   - Navigate to the `backend/` directory.
   - Install the Go dependencies:

     ```bash
     cd backend
     go mod tidy
     ```

   - Start the Go server:

     ```bash
     go run main.go
     ```

   The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

3. **Set up the frontend (React)**:

   - Navigate to the `frontend/` directory.
   - Install the React dependencies:

     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```

   - Start the React development server:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

   The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Configuration

You may want to configure the environment variables to suit your deployment needs. Create a `.env` file in both the `frontend/` and `backend/` directories and configure them as necessary:

- **Frontend (`.env`)**:
  - `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080`
  
- **Backend (`.env`)**:
  - `PORT=8080`
  - `JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key`
  - (Optional) `DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string`

### Running in Production

1. Build the frontend:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Serve the React app through your Go server or use any static file server.

### Usage üßë‚Äçüíª

- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
- Log in or sign up with your credentials.
- Join a room and start chatting with other users in real-time!
  
You can also customize room names and invite friends via links.
